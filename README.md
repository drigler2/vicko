# Getting Started

### Vicko
Vicko is a Spring-boot example/template app. It's not intended to be deployed as-is as it's 
missing some important components such as user-management etc...

App displays a list of jokes which can be up/down voted, jokes can be added. To add a joke
user must be logged in. 
DB will be initialized on startup, POSTGRES is hard-coded but it can probably work with other 
vendors as long as schemas are supported. POSTGRES data types should be replaced 
with vendor supported ones in DB migrations.
